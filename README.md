# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python.

The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack. The objective is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.
